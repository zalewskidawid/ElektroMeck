# Business Card - Elektromeck
## Project Description
The Elektromeck business card project is a simple, responsive website created for a colleague. It has been implemented using Vue.js, a popular JavaScript framework that enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications. The project also utilizes the GSAP animation library to add visual effects and interactivity to the website. Styling is done using SCSS, a preprocessor that allows for easy management of styles in interface design. To add an additional effect, the Particles.js library is used, which generates dynamic background animations. The EmailJS technology is employed to handle the contact form, allowing for direct communication with the company via email from the website's form.
